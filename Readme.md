 INTRODUCTION
 ------------

 Firehose CMS is being developed to build on the foundations of older PHP based CMS systems like Drupal, Wordpress, and Django while ridding itself of the bloat and speed issues associated with those legacy CMS systems.

 The CMS will be built using Typescript to generate a NodeJS application.
